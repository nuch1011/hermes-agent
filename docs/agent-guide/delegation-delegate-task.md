## Delegation (`delegate_task`)

`tools/delegate_tool.py` spawns a subagent with an isolated
context + terminal session. Synchronous: the parent waits for the
child's summary before continuing its own loop — if the parent is
interrupted, the child is cancelled.

Two shapes:

- **Single:** pass `goal` (+ optional `context`, `toolsets`).
- **Batch (parallel):** pass `tasks: [...]` — each gets its own subagent
  running concurrently. Concurrency is capped by
  `delegation.max_concurrent_children` (default 3).

Roles:

- `role="leaf"` (default) — focused worker. Cannot call `delegate_task`,
  `clarify`, `memory`, `send_message`, `execute_code`.
- `role="orchestrator"` — retains `delegate_task` so it can spawn its
  own workers. Gated by `delegation.orchestrator_enabled` (default true)
  and bounded by `delegation.max_spawn_depth` (default 2).

Key config knobs (under `delegation:` in `config.yaml`):
`max_concurrent_children`, `max_spawn_depth`, `child_timeout_seconds`,
`orchestrator_enabled`, `subagent_auto_approve`, `inherit_mcp_toolsets`,
`max_iterations`.

Synchronicity rule: delegate_task is **not** durable. For long-running
work that must outlive the current turn, use `cronjob` or
`terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)` instead.
