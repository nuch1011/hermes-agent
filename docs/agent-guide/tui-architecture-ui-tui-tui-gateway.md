## TUI Architecture (ui-tui + tui_gateway)

The TUI is a full replacement for the classic (prompt_toolkit) CLI, activated via `hermes --tui` or `HERMES_TUI=1`.

### Process Model

```
hermes --tui
  └─ Node (Ink)  ──stdio JSON-RPC──  Python (tui_gateway)
       │                                  └─ AIAgent + tools + sessions
       └─ renders transcript, composer, prompts, activity
```

TypeScript owns the screen. Python owns sessions, tools, model calls, and slash command logic.

### Transport

Newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio. Requests from Ink, events from Python. See `tui_gateway/server.py` for the full method/event catalog.

### Key Surfaces

| Surface | Ink component | Gateway method |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Chat streaming | `app.tsx` + `messageLine.tsx` | `prompt.submit` → `message.delta/complete` |
| Tool activity | `thinking.tsx` | `tool.start/progress/complete` |
| Approvals | `prompts.tsx` | `approval.respond` ← `approval.request` |
| Clarify/sudo/secret | `prompts.tsx`, `maskedPrompt.tsx` | `clarify/sudo/secret.respond` |
| Session picker | `sessionPicker.tsx` | `session.list/resume` |
| Slash commands | Local handler + fallthrough | `slash.exec` → `_SlashWorker`, `command.dispatch` |
| Completions | `useCompletion` hook | `complete.slash`, `complete.path` |
| Theming | `theme.ts` + `branding.tsx` | `gateway.ready` with skin data |

### Slash Command Flow

1. Built-in client commands (`/help`, `/quit`, `/clear`, `/resume`, `/copy`, `/paste`, etc.) handled locally in `app.tsx`
2. Everything else → `slash.exec` (runs in persistent `_SlashWorker` subprocess) → `command.dispatch` fallback

### Dev Commands

```bash
cd ui-tui
npm install       # first time
npm run dev       # watch mode (rebuilds hermes-ink + tsx --watch)
npm start         # production
npm run build     # full build (hermes-ink + tsc)
npm run type-check # typecheck only (tsc --noEmit)
npm run lint      # eslint
npm run fmt       # prettier
npm test          # vitest
```

### TUI in the Dashboard (`hermes dashboard` → `/chat`)

The dashboard embeds the real `hermes --tui` — **not** a rewrite.  See `hermes_cli/pty_bridge.py` + the `@app.websocket("/api/pty")` endpoint in `hermes_cli/web_server.py`.

- Browser loads `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`, which mounts xterm.js's `Terminal` with the WebGL renderer, `@xterm/addon-fit` for container-driven resize, and `@xterm/addon-unicode11` for modern wide-character widths.
- `/api/pty?token=…` upgrades to a WebSocket; auth uses the same ephemeral `_SESSION_TOKEN` as REST, via query param (browsers can't set `Authorization` on WS upgrade).
- The server spawns whatever `hermes --tui` would spawn, through `ptyprocess` (POSIX PTY — WSL works, native Windows does not).
- Frames: raw PTY bytes each direction; resize via `\x1b[RESIZE:<cols>;<rows>]` intercepted on the server and applied with `TIOCSWINSZ`.

**Do not re-implement the primary chat experience in React.** The main transcript, composer/input flow (including slash-command behavior), and PTY-backed terminal belong to the embedded `hermes --tui` — anything new you add to Ink shows up in the dashboard automatically. If you find yourself rebuilding the transcript or composer for the dashboard, stop and extend Ink instead.

**Structured React UI around the TUI is allowed when it is not a second chat surface.** Sidebar widgets, inspectors, summaries, status panels, and similar supporting views (e.g. `ChatSidebar`, `ModelPickerDialog`, `ToolCall`) are fine when they complement the embedded TUI rather than replacing the transcript / composer / terminal. Keep their state independent of the PTY child's session and surface their failures non-destructively so the terminal pane keeps working unimpaired.
